# Flutter Learning Labs

A personal learning repository focused on building strong Flutter fundamentals through hands-on practice and iterative improvement.

---

## Goals
- Build strong Flutter fundamentals
- Practice clean widget structure and predictable state handling
- Develop habits aligned with real-world Flutter development
- Apply a defensive mindset when handling user input and app logic

---

## Structure
Each directory represents a focused learning module:
- UI & layout basics
- State management fundamentals
- Navigation
- Forms and validation

Modules are added and refined progressively as understanding improves.

---

## Development Approach
This repository emphasizes:
- Clear and readable Flutter code
- Explicit state updates to avoid unintended behavior
- Basic input validation where applicable
- Separation of UI and logic as complexity increases

The goal is to build applications that are easy to reason about, maintain, and improve over time.

---

## Notes
- Code is intentionally simple and learning-focused
- Not intended to be production-ready
- Refactored regularly as concepts become clearer
- Prioritizes correctness and clarity over premature optimization

## Status
🚧 Actively in progress
